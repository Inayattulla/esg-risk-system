ESG REPORT 2023-24
PRUDENCE & RESILIENCE
Corporate Overview

MD & CEO’s message
Embracing prudence 
and resilience to build a 
sustainable world
Your Company is taking meaningful action and has 
embarked on a transformative journey where success 
is not just measured by the traditional metrics. It is my 
pleasure to present our inaugural Environmental, Social 
and Governance (ESG) report, which is a testament to our 
commitment towards shaping a sustainable future, not only 
for your Company but for the whole world.
As we deeply integrate responsible practices within your 
Company, our business framework is anchored on the 
core ESG Pillars to reduce our environmental footprint, 
enhance our contribution to the communities we serve, 
and strengthen our governance practices through 
ongoing collaborations with our esteemed stakeholders 
including our partners, workforce, investors, shareholders 
and consumers.
Our aim is to create enduring value for each stakeholder 
by delivering purposeful business outcomes. We strive to 
achieve business success while connecting with individuals 
and communities worldwide through our on-screen 
content and off-screen endeavours in the realm of women 
empowerment, integrated rural development, public health 
enhancement, preservation of our cultural heritage and 
disaster relief and recovery.
Building value beyond the bottomline
Taking a crucial step towards sustainable development, we 
have meticulously mapped our ESG footprints across our 
operations and offices in India. Our consolidated efforts to 
oversee, regulate, and enhance our ESG performance are 
detailed in this report. We have taken conscious efforts to 
reduce our carbon, water, and energy footprints, and this 
report reflects the results we have achieved in each of 
these areas along with the impact we had on community 
development through our CSR initiatives.
We recognize that responsible governance forms the 
foundation of a resilient organization, and we have taken 
necessary steps to consistently strengthen our corporate 
governance framework with robust policies and processes 
that enable us to maintain a sharp focus on stakeholder 
engagement and mitigate risks. We further reaffirm our 
commitment to enhance stakeholder value creation by 
continuously refining our governance practices centred 
around transparency, accountability and responsibility.
For this report, our Company’s ESG priorities and strategies 
were determined following a comprehensive ESG double 
materiality assessment conducted in 2023 in collaboration 
with an external third-party agency. This assessment 
shed light on the external ESG effects of our organisation, 
our environmental and social impact, and the robust 
governance practices that were meticulously evaluated 
across the organisation. This assessment enabled us 
to map significant material issues and priority areas to 
implement ESG initiatives within your Company.
Our sustainable business philosophy is centred 
on prioritising ecological responsibility over profit 
maximisation. We are meticulously implementing 
sustainable practices in every facet of our operations to 
reduce our carbon footprint.
Act for impact
The concerted efforts towards our ESG goals have led 
to remarkable accomplishments within your Company. 
This includes investing over 3,000 hours in personal and 
professional development, mapping our Green House 
Gas (GHG) emissions for FY 2023-24, reducing the 
waste sent to landfills, achieving a 19.5% representation 
of women in our workforce, and establishing a strong 
cybersecurity programme based on ISO 27001 standards 
to safeguard our consumer data.
Dear Stakeholders,
The rapidly evolving Media & Entertainment 
sector is increasingly being defined by creativity 
and its ability to entertain and inform consumers. 
Amidst this, your Company recognises its 
responsibility towards the consumers and 
society at large. Our stories touch billions 
of hearts and with every narrative we craft, 
we believe that we possess the power to 
inspire change and spark conversations and 
actions that ultimately drive positive societal 
progress. At ZEE, we remain committed towards 
delivering successful business outcomes with 
purpose, guided by our rich value system and 
core purpose of enriching the lives of people 
around the world by creating extraordinary 
moments that celebrate the power of optimism 
and togetherness.

PRUDENCE & RESILIENCE
Corporate Overview

Additionally, we remain dedicated to managing air quality 
and ambient noise levels, proper disposal of waste, and 
recycling wastewater. Furthermore, we have implemented 
measures to monitor and control greenhouse gas 
emissions and conserve energy with state-of-the 
art, energy-efficient technology at every stage of 
our operations.
With sustainability as a cornerstone of future growth and 
innovation, our businesses also mirror this philosophy. Our 
advertisements comply with rigorous clearance standards, 
considering brand sensitivities, audience ratings, 
demographics, and the nature of content.
We are also promoting conscious practices through our 
on-screen content as well, motivating viewers to embrace 
eco-friendly practices. This can be testified through the 
upcycling initiatives featured across our shows, including 
‘House Party Hits’, local sourcing in ‘Farm to Table’, and 
segments like ‘Green Essentials’ and ‘Sensible Earth’ 
providing in-depth insights into sustainable living.
Culture of connect
The only way to achieve progress is by nurturing a 
motivated and collaborative work environment that results 
in a culture of creativity and innovation across the business. 
We have taken significant efforts to improve employee 
well-being, health, and safety, in addition to human 
resource management and stakeholder engagement.
As a responsible corporate citizen, your Company 
prioritises the physical and mental well-being of its 
workforce by implementing robust safety measures, 
encouraging a positive work environment, and providing 
extensive wellness programs.
We emphasize fairness, objectivity, and inclusivity when 
evaluating employee performance, aligning it with our 
sustainability objectives through our yearly assessment 
procedure. Female employees are entitled to a range of 
exceptional maternity benefits, including an additional 
4 weeks leave, which exceeds the statutory leave of 
26 weeks, while our medical insurance   policies are 
highly comprehensive, offering top-up options, parental 
coverage, and various benefits for our workforce.
All our human resources processes are transparent 
and aligned towards enhancing employee skills and 
capabilities to enhance performance and drive long-
term    organisational success. As an Academy of Talent, 
we believe in fostering a workplace where every individual 
feels valued, respected, and empowered to contribute 
their unique perspectives through focused initiatives 
on promoting diversity across all levels, implementing 
inclusive policies and practices, and cultivating a sense         
of belonging.
Walking into a better tomorrow
Our belief in the power of storytelling to bring about 
social change remains firm and we remain committed 
to leveraging the strength and reach of our platforms to 
address important societal issues.
As we move forward, we are mindful that the journey 
towards building a sustainable tomorrow is ongoing and 
requires the collective effort of all our stakeholders.
I want to express my gratitude to you, our esteemed 
shareholders, along with our employees and partners, for 
your unwavering support, which consistently empowers  
us to not only entertain and inform, but to make a lasting, 
positive impact on society and the environment. Together, 
we are not only building a robust and value-accretive 
Company for the future, but also contributing towards 
shaping a legacy that resonates well beyond a screen.
Yours Sincerely,
Punit Goenka
MD & CEO

In-house automation of the power factor bank and 
optimisation of the power factor of electrical supply 
from Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited 
(UPPCL). This measure could result in an estimated 
saving of 71,030 KWH in losses.
Replacement of an energy-efficient AHU and 
optimisation of the Air-Cooling System (ACS). 
We have replaced 30 old and inefficient AHUs with 
EC fan-based energy-efficient AHUs, and we are 
getting 40 to 45% energy savings per AHU. The overall 
estimated saving is 0.76 KWH
The above measures could save up to `4.2 million 
per annum.
The above implementation activities were initiated in 
FY 2022-23 with 30% completion and continued in 
FY 2023-24 with balance 70% completion done during 
the year.
Energy saving measures
We have mapped our carbon emissions and measures 
taken through the energy management programme for 
reducing energy use through energy saving measures 
given below.
In FY 2022-23 and FY 2023-24, energy-saving measures 
were taken by our project and engineering teams at the 
ZEE Noida office. These energy saving activities were to 
replace old UPS and AHU with energy-efficient, latest-
technology units. The implementation activities are given 
as below:
Exploring and installing an energy-efficient 
UPS systems.
The old UPS with efficiency of 0.88% was replaced with 
a new UPS with an efficiency of 0.945%. This will result 
in heat loss reduction and estimated annual saving 
of 82,165 KWH and 171,176 KWH for the two models 
i.e. UPS 120 and UPS 250, respectively.
Air quality management
Cleaner air, 
greener future
Our Company recognises the significance of monitoring air 
quality, both from stationary sources and at ambient levels. 
Adhering to air quality standards is vital for public health, making 
it essential to assess key air quality parameters. ZEE conducts 
regular monitoring of its air emissions and has implemented 
measures to minimise emission sources. This includes monitoring 
stack emissions from Diesel Generator (DG) sets and gas plants 
utilised for power generation, maintaining green landscaping in 
office premises, prohibiting the open storage of organic waste 
on-site, promoting indoor plantation within offices, and ensuring 
systematic maintenance of AHUs.
Ambient air quality at our Noida office premises are monitored through a 
government-approved laboratory as per the 2009 National Ambient Air Quality 
Monitoring Standard (NAAQS). This activity is conducted once a year at three 
locations on the premises.

Water and wastewater management
Prioritise reuse, 
reduce waste
Water consumption
Water consumption at our facilities primarily 
serves drinking and various domestic uses. 
Water is a vital natural resource that we use 
with great efficiency. We place a high priority 
on the conservation and optimal utilisation of 
water within our premises.
The wastewater generated after water use is 
treated at a wastewater treatment plant, and 
the treated water is reused for flushing and 
gardening systems within the premises.
Our water consumption needs are met through the 
municipal supply for domestic use, purchase of bottled 
water for drinking, and groundwater extraction, all third-
party sources. Our total water consumption matches our 
water withdrawal from these external sources.
The water consumption data for FY 2022-23 and 
FY 2023-24 are provided below:

Wastewater generated from ZEE offices is sent to the builder’s sewage treatment plant (STP). The treated water is recycled 
for domestic use, such as toilet flushing, in most of our office locations.
Waste management
Conserve resources, 
preserve environment
In our commitment to sustainability, we have embraced a comprehensive approach 
to the circular economy in our daily operations. We recognise that effective waste 
management is vital for environmental conservation and resource optimisation. 
Therefore, we ensure that waste generation, segregation, and minimisation are 
integral to all our operational processes.
One of the crucial factors in environmental protection 
and resource optimisation is having a vigorous waste 
management process in an organisation. Waste generation, 
segregation, quantification, and disposal are parts of waste 
management that we follow at ZEE. In FY 2022-23 and 
FY 2023-24, we have quantified our waste into hazardous 
and non-hazardous categories.

Hazardous waste
Hazardous waste, such as electronic waste, used oil, and 
batteries, are disposed off through authorised recyclers. 
After systematic disposal of hazardous waste to recyclers, 
a green certificate for disposal, Form 10-HW manifest, and 
waste logbook are maintained. Hazardous waste disposal 
is manged through different teams such as E-waste is 
disposed off through IT team, used oil and used batteries 
are disposed by the administration team.
Non-hazardous waste
Non-hazardous waste from our offices, including wet, 
paper, plastic, and metal waste, is managed per our waste 
management procedures. Waste is sorted at the source 
into wet and dry categories. Dry waste (paper, plastic, 
metal) is sent to recyclers to avoid landfills, while wet waste 
(food scraps and organic materials) generated at our offices 
is processed at the builder’s facility. Segregated non-
hazardous waste is quantified before further disposal.

Embracing technology in ESG management
Leveraging technology, 
enhancing sustainability
In the current dynamic business environment, 
we recognise the necessity and importance 
of prioritising decarbonisation and adhering 
to strict ESG criteria more than ever. 
We have adopted technology for data 
monitoring and gathering with customised 
tools across all our sustainability initiatives, 
significantly boosting our Company’s capacity 
to achieve sustainability targets and enhance 
transparency.
We collect data related to environmental trends, carbon 
emissions, waste and water management, diversity and 
inclusion (DEI) patterns, training, governance parameters, 
etc. through a web-based customised tool implemented 
in FY 2023-24. This tool manages our end-to-end 
sustainability journey with a simplified process that 
lets us manage, report, and analyse ESG data on one 
platform. This tool not only streamlines data collection 
and management, but also accommodates multiple layers 
of data validation and creates audit trails. 
The data collated through this tool is analysed regularly 
by leadership team members to derive meaningful insights 
and foresee trends. This proactive approach allows our 
Company to assess ESG trends at ZEE.

Diverse and inclusive content
Delivering multifaceted 
perspectives
We are committed to fostering a diverse 
media landscape through our inclusive 
content format. Our goal is to promote 
inclusivity, showcase a wide range of 
narratives, and build a talent pool that reflects 
India’s rich diversity while empowering 
women both on and off-screen.
We nurture a diverse talent pool that reflects 
Indian society, focusing on empowering 
emerging voices. Our non-fiction programmes 
provide opportunities for around 100,000 
new talents in genres like singing, dancing, 
comedy, and reality television, aiming to 
create a more inclusive media environment.
Padamati Sandhyaragam, ZEE Telugu
Our Company is dedicated to empowering women both 
on and off-screen. Our programming celebrates Women 
talent and entrepreneurial spirit. Shows like ‘Goan Gullies’, 
‘Highway Dreams’, and ‘Shonar Bengal’ feature inspiring 
stories of women like Sonia Shirat and highlight women-
led businesses. By sharing these narratives, we empower 
women and encourage audiences to recognise and 
celebrate their achievements, fostering a more equitable 
media landscape.
ZEE proudly hosted the ‘Uncha Majha Jhoka’ awards, 
honouring extraordinary women who challenge 
conventions and inspire others. The event celebrated 
diverse group of achievers like young cricket prodigy 
Jemimah Rodrigues and groundbreaking cancer researcher 
Dr. Darshana Patil, celebrating their relentless spirit and 
significant impact. These awards reflect our commitment to 
empowering women and acknowledging their remarkable 
contributions to society.
The viewer is at the heart of everything 
we do!
At Zee, the consumer is our guiding compass. India’s 
population diversity and rich cultural tapestry offer a vast 
array of content opportunities. With 1.3 billion people 
belonging to diverse linguistic, religious, and regional 
backgrounds, content creators have the chance to craft 
narratives that resonate deeply with different segments 
of society.
We have been at the forefront of leveraging this 
opportunity. Being pioneers in Indian content over 
generations, we are forever obsessed with building 
consumer focus at the heart of everything we do.  
We call this our ‘Soul-to-Screen’ approach, which we 
believe will build the next level of our competitive 
advantage. It is a design philosophy where consumer 
inspiration triggers content ideas.
In the ‘Soul-to-Screen’ approach, we strive to be an 
intrinsic part of our consumers’ native world—their core 
beliefs, thought processes, fears, desires, and dreams. 
This understanding enables us to craft stories that 
connect with diverse audience sets, which in many ways 
emanate from their personal experiences. An important 
mechanism for achieving this is to ensure that consumer 
immersion becomes an ongoing way of life for us across 
the organisation and at all levels. In FY 2023-24, we have 
met 35,000+ consumers across languages and diverse 
socio-economic backgrounds to understand their world. 
Diversity and inclusion are in everything we do!
Diversity and Inclusion in everything 
we do!
Through our shows, we have always endeavoured to craft 
stories that represent diverse communities and cultures. 
A constant endeavour is to ‘inspire, aspire, and empower’ 
women across all regions, religions, working statuses, age 
groups, affluence levels, and abilities.

Board election process
The Nomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC) 
evaluates the profiles of various candidates for the position 
of directors. The NRC identifies the skills, expertise, and 
competencies required by the Board for the effective 
functioning of our Company. We consistently seek highly 
qualified professionals from diverse fields who possess 
the credentials and experience as Board members in their 
previous and current roles, thereby contributing valuable 
insights and expertise in their areas of specialisation. 
To enhance the Board’s competencies, the NRC evaluates 
candidates based on criteria such as qualifications, skill 
sets, experience, independence, knowledge, and their 
capacity to dedicate adequate time and attention to the 
responsibilities of an Independent or Non-executive 
Director. This process results in a shortlist of candidates 
from a variety of backgrounds, including corporate 
professionals, consultants, and industrialists.
The NRC had specified that the new board member 
should have a deeper understanding and expertise in the 
following areas:
Board performance review
Under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and 
SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015, the evaluation of the annual 
performance of the Directors, Board, and Board 
Committees was carried out for FY 2023-24. 
The details of the evaluation process are set out in the 
corporate governance report, which forms part of the 
Annual Report of our Company. The performance of 
Non-independent Directors, the Board as a whole, and 
the Chairman of our Company was evaluated in a separate 
meeting of Independent Directors.
Further, at the Board meeting, followed by the meeting 
of the Independent Directors, the performance of the 
Board, its committees, and individual Directors was also 
discussed. The performance evaluation of Independent 
Directors was done by the entire Board, excluding the 
Independent Director being evaluated.

any potential risk and exposures.
Business conduct
The Code of Conduct is the primary guide and reference 
point for the daily management and operation of our 
company and its business. It is designed to encourage 
discussions about ethics and improve our handling of 
the ethical dilemmas, biases, and grey areas that we face 
in our everyday work. The Code outlines fundamental 
principles for carrying out our Company’s business in 
alignment with the utmost standards of business ethics. 
The primary objective of this Code is to create a shared 
comprehension of the expected behavioural standards 
within our Company. It does not aim to offer an extensive 
list of actions to take in every work scenario. Rather, it 
serves as a comprehensive structure to assist us in making 
ethical decisions when confronted with dilemmas. Our goal 
is to operate ethically, legally, sustainably, with integrity, 
and in compliance with the applicable laws.
Board Type
Our Board is formed as on-tier system which includes 
Independent Directors and an Executive Director. 
This on-tier system is represented as below table.
	• In-house Centre of Excellence as far as regulatory 
frameworks covering SEBI, MCA, CBDT, and other 
regulatory nodal bodies proves as a catalysts to 
the MD & CEO and the Board on taking informed 
decisions based on the governance aspects within the 
organisation amidst the evolving regulatory landscape.
	• Expertise across all aspects of strategic finance, 
including tax, Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A), 
divestments, strategic restructuring, systems and 
processes, and risk management.
	• Networks in the various industry associations and 
bodies to advise the MD & CEO and the Board on 
effectively representing our Company's core issues 
and interests.
	• Understanding CSR and related issues would be 
an added advantage for a new Board member, 
given the criticality of CSR deployments in the 
emerging landscape.
Accordingly, from the shortlisted candidates, the NRC 
selects and recommends to the Board the appointment of 
an Independent or Non-executive or Executive Director of 
our Company.
Based on the recommendations from the NRC and after 
receiving confirmation of independence or declarations 
from the proposed directors, the Board appoints them as 
an additional director in the category of Executive, Non-
executive, or Independent Director, subject to the approval 
of the shareholders of our Company.
Eventually, we obtain the approval of the shareholders 
of our Company, under Regulation 17 (1C) of the SEBI 
(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015, at the next general meeting or within 
three months from the date of appointment, whichever is 
earlier. We also seek approval from Ministry of Information 
and Broadcasting (MIB) for appointment of new directors. 
Our Nomination and Remuneration Policy provides a brief 
on the management decisions and governance practices 
for both the nomination and remuneration of the members 
of the Board of Directors and members of the Strategic 
Committee, such as senior management personnel, key 
managerial personnel, and other employees of ZEE.

Risk management
Mitigating and  
governing risks
The foundation of our Company’s operations 
is built upon effective risk management. This 
practice not only strengthens our reputation 
but also improves the environment in which 
we operate while aiding our strategy for 
sustainable growth and success. We have 
implemented a strong risk management 
framework at ZEE.
Our Company has implemented a robust risk management 
framework. Our risk policy describes risk governance, 
risk culture, risk framework, roles, and responsibilities 
in the risk management process. The Risk Management 
Committee oversees the risk management process and is 
a 3 (three) member committee, including two Independent 
Directors and the Company CFO. The Risk Management 
Committee oversees matters related to key risks, 
including operational risk, liquidity risk, technology risk, 
environmental risk, social risk, governance risk, market 
risk, product risk, reputational risk, etc. and guidelines, 
policies, and processes that are in place for monitoring and 
mitigating such risks. The Committee reports to the Board 
regarding their considerations and actions.
The Board of Directors of our Company has adopted 
the risk policy upon recommendation by RMC. Our risk 
management process focusses on identifying strategic, 
operational, financial, and regulatory risks. The CRO 
conducts third-party ERM exercises, with a focus on 
various risk monitoring strategies, i.e. external as well as 
internal risk.
Risks identified internally
Four stages of our risk management 
process
	• Risk identification and preparation of a risk register are 
reviewed by RMC annually, and a complete refresh is 
conducted once every three years.
	• Risk prioritisation results in prioritising Risk That Matters 
(RTM) and significant risk. The oversight for risk rating 
is conducted by the MD & CEO, the CFO, and any other 
senior management personnel with relevant oversight 
and responsibilities.
	• Risk mitigation occurs when mitigation plans are 
prepared to address prioritised risks. A risk owner is 
assigned to each prioritised risk and is responsible for 
the development, implementation, and reporting of the 
agreed mitigation plans to the RMC.
	• Risk oversight, monitoring and review - Risk reporting 
relating to prioritised risks are driven by the CRO and 
provided to the RMC. Senior management risk and 
control owners are responsible for monitoring risks and 
the effectiveness of their countermeasures.
Emerging risks 
As the internal and external environment within which our 
Company operates is exposed to continuous change, the 
risk management process must remain sufficiently flexible 
to accommodate new situations as they arise. We continue 
to track emerging risks in the media and entertainment 
industries and take proactive measures to mitigate the 
impact. Below are the key emerging risks identified by 
our Company.
Shift from Pay TV to OTT/Freedish
An industry-level risk that would play out in the 
long term. Shift of higher income audience to 
Digital video and OTT could potentially lead to 
a reduction in TV watch time. Broadcast viewing 
over time could shift to VOD on Digital/OTT.
Pay TV homes have remained stable. Four leading FTA 
GECs have been pulled back by all major players and now 
moved to the Pay channel category. Consumer research 
indicates that for hybrid consumers, TV consumption 
(hours) remains the same while Digital consumption adds 
on as a net increment. In Television, the Soul-to-Screen 
method and plans are put in place to make more relevant 
content. In social/digital, ZEE is building institutional 
strength across digital video platforms (Facebook, 
Instagram) to gain viewers on television. AVOD content 
moved behind a paywall in three key language markets – 
Marathi, Telugu, and Bangla, as an experiment to protect 
the Pay TV subscriber base, while exploring SVOD models.
Ultimately, in FTA with seven channels we have strong 
presence in movies and regional languages.
High
Mitigation plan
Risk description & impact
Content piracy/IP protection
Most of the digital content on OTT platforms 
is available on pirated sites and file-sharing 
apps like Telegram. Piracy not only affects the 
subscriptions but also the advertising revenue 
since it is based on viewership. According to 
one report, advertising and subscription-led 
video streaming services are losing up to 30% 
of their annual revenue to piracy. Also, currently, 
Zee5 is playable on old smart TVs which do not 
support DRM playback which increases the risk 
of piracy. Continuous investment is therefore 
necessary to upgrade the technology for better 
content protection.
Instead of being dependent on a watermarking solution 
(client-side) and agency to strike down the infringements, 
the issue has been addressed at the source in a non-
conventional way through an in-house tool.
This has resulted in -
	• 100% reduction in mod APK/inline access of Zee5 
content using the in-house developed tool.
	• 90% reduction in offline piracy where the content was 
pirated from Zee5 CDN directly.
	• Other implemented initiatives:
	
 Introduction of server-side watermarking, to identify 
every copy of pirated content leaked by any means/
source.
	
 User Data Encryption (Data Security).

Ethics and integrity
Upholding integrity 
and ethical conduct
Our Company values ethics and integrity 
as fundamental principles that shape 
our interactions with each other. We are 
dedicated to creating a work environment 
that is free from any form of offensive or 
disrespectful conduct. Our Company adheres 
to all local laws that prohibit discrimination, 
and our Code of Conduct forbids any form of 
harassment at workplace.
We adhere rigorously to the stipulations outlined in the 
Code of Conduct that governs employees, directors, and 
management Teams. It is mandatory for all employees, 
senior management, and directors to undergo training 
on the Code of Conduct immediately upon joining ZEE. 
This Code is applicable to all employees, consultants, 
contractual personnel, interns, vendors, shareholders, 
customers, suppliers, community representatives, and 
other business associates of ZEE and its subsidiaries. 
The Code must be observed at all times while on our 
premises, at client sites, during company-sponsored 
business events, and at various social gatherings. 
The HR department of our Company and its subsidiaries 
is responsible for the promotion, monitoring, and 
enforcement of this Code. Nevertheless, the ultimate 
obligation to adhere to the Code’s requirements and foster 
a culture of ethical excellence lies with every individual 
within the organisation.
Our human rights commitment
We are committed to fostering a safe and respectful 
workplace through our POSH policy and Code of Conduct. 
We prioritise creating an inclusive environment free 
from harassment where every employee feels secure 
and valued. 
Our comprehensive POSH framework includes robust 
reporting mechanisms, regular training sessions, and strict 
adherence to legal requirements. In conformity with the 
directive of the Supreme Court of India and provisions 
of the Act, an Internal Committee (IC), as per the law, has 
been constituted at 14 administrative units or offices.
This commitment not only strengthens our corporate 
governance but also enhances trust among stakeholders 
and reinforces our sustainable business practices.
Responsible content and advertising
We are committed to responsible advertising that 
complements our high-quality programming. Our ads 
undergo strict clearance protocols, considering brand 
sensitivities, audience demographics, and program 
content. We align with viewers’ and advertisers’ 
expectations by restricting inappropriate ads for younger 
viewers and ensure proper placement for categories like 
alcohol. We comply with all laws and industry standards, 
prohibiting ads for tobacco, firearms, pornography, 
and illegal products, while ensuring no discrimination 
based on race, caste, colour, or nationality. We further 
uphold our commitment by adhering to the program and 
advertising codes prescribed under the Cable Television 
Network Rules of 1994. We conduct ongoing reviews of 
advertisements, including viewer flags, to maintain high 
standards and best practices.
Through engaging programming, we champion 
sustainability. Our shows inspire viewers to adopt eco-
conscious practices, like upcycling projects in ‘House 
Party Hits’. Travel adventures promote responsible 
tourism and eco-friendly exploration, while ‘Farm to Table’ 
educates on local sourcing. Show segments like ‘Green 
Essentials’ and ‘Sensible Earth’ delve deeper into green 
living. This commitment extends beyond entertainment, 
with travel programming actively showcasing sustainable 
travel options.
Grievance redressal mechanism
Viewers are our most valued stakeholders. We have 
established a robust Grievance Redressal Mechanism 
(GRM) to receive feedback from our viewers. As per this 
mechanism, a designated Grievance Redressal Officer 
(GRO) addresses feedbacks and comments received 
from the viewers. A dedicated section called ‘Grievance 
Redressal’ has been provided on ZEE’s website, where 
viewers can submit forms. After receipt of viewers forms 
we acknowledge it within 24 hours and respond within 
15 days. On an average, we receive up to 6–8 content-
related feedback and comments every month.

 Data privacy and cybersecurity
 Tax vision and strategy
Securing privacy, 
safeguarding data
Taxation vision and 
strategic direction
Tax is a crucial aspect of our Company’s 
governance and business facilitation. As an 
Indian headquartered company (operations 
across global geographies), we are dedicated 
to contributing our fair share of tax revenue 
through direct and indirect taxes in India and 
abroad. We prioritise maintaining integrity in 
our tax reporting and mitigating risks within 
legal boundaries.
Ensuring strong information security and cybersecurity 
is crucial for safeguarding our assets, reputation, and 
stakeholder trust. Collaboration between executive 
management and business leaders is key to aligning our 
cybersecurity strategy. The CISO convenes the Information 
Security and Privacy Steering Committee (ISPSC), which is 
a dedicated management committee with representation 
from business and functional senior leadership that 
reviews risks, mitigation plans, and initiatives to ensure 
the continued suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness 
of the security and privacy posture. The risk inputs are 
shared with the Enterprise Risk and Compliance teams for 
further discussion with the ERM and the Board. Our policy 
is designed to align with business and security objectives, 
which conveys the importance of information security and 
privacy threats and best practices. The information security 
and privacy policies and procedures are published in the 
intranet portal and communicated to all employees.
We employ comprehensive employee awareness training 
to strengthen our information security and cybersecurity 
culture. Our program includes various mandatory 
cybersecurity awareness initiatives such as gamified 
induction training, annual employee policy refresher 
training, quarterly ethical phishing simulation tests with 
knowledge imparting sessions, monthly contractor 
awareness trainings, weekly awareness mailers, WhatsApp 
messages, and secure coding for developers. Beyond 
technical skills, we emphasise the role of everyone in 
safeguarding our data by educating our employees, 
including the contract staff, and making them understand, 
identify, and avoid prevalent and new cyber threats.
Information security risk insurance for ZEEL
In addition to our existing cybersecurity safeguards, 
in the event of unforeseen attacks from adversaries, 
to protect and minimise the impact, ZEEL has taken the 
Cyber insurance providing crucial protection against 
financial losses from cyber threats such as data breaches 
and ransomware.
We have implemented a robust and comprehensive privacy 
program based on principles of lawfulness, fairness, 
transparency, purpose limitation, data minimisation, 
accuracy, storage limitation, integrity, confidentiality 
(security), and accountability to give our consumers 
meaningful controls over their personal data. We regularly 
assess and update our privacy programme to meet the 
requirements of emerging privacy laws and regulations 
worldwide, and to keep up with rapid advancements in 
technology and new business initiatives. We develop 
and maintain policies, controls, and best practices for 
the collection, use, and sharing of personal information 
while meeting business needs and mitigating legal and 
reputational risks. Children's Privacy is very important to us, 
and as a leading media and entertainment company, our 
services are intentionally designed for or directed at persons 
who are at least 18 years of age and older. As a policy, 
we do not seek, intend to seek, or receive any personal 
information from children. More information about how 
we protect data rights is available at our Privacy Portal.
We obtained the ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certification in 
October 2022 for Information Security Management 
Systems (ISMS), demonstrating our commitment to 
maintaining the highest standards of information security. 
The ISO 27001 certificate is valid until October 2025. 
The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) holds a pivotal 
position in our Company, tasked with safeguarding our 
organisation's digital assets and protecting against evolving 
cyber threats by overseeing risk management, developing 
and enforcing policies, coordinating incident response and 
recovery efforts, conducting security awareness training, 
ensuring compliance with regulations and governance 
frameworks, and collaborating with stakeholders.
Tax vision and strategy
Tax plays a pivotal role in our organisation as a 
governance and business-enabling function. Being an 
Indian multinational, we are committed to a fair share 
of tax revenue, whether in the form of direct taxes or 
indirect taxes, in India and overseas jurisdictions such as 
Mauritius, the UK, the USA, the Middle East, and South 
Africa, where the group majorly operates. Tax positions are 
well documented and supported by opinions from third-
party experts, including Big 4 consulting firms and senior 
counsels. We ensure integrity in tax compliance reporting 
and ring-fencing risk within the four corners of the law. 
Within the laid-down parameters of tax laws, the tax head, 
along with his team, ensures that tax risks are identified 
upfront, and a mitigation strategy is developed in case of 
any potential tax exposures that may arise.
We have zero tolerance for any tax regulatory non-
compliance, and to date, we are above board on 
compliance aspects. In appropriate circumstances, we seek 
certainty on inherently uncertain tax positions by obtaining 
external advice or by seeking advance clearance with the 
relevant tax authority. We seek to adhere to relevant tax 
laws in all countries where we do business. 
We engage in efficient tax planning that supports 
our business and reflects commercial and economic 
activity. We do not engage in artificial tax arrangements. 
We strongly believe that non-tax compulsion i.e. commercial 
rationale drives the selection of an overseas jurisdiction for 
doing business, and tax benefits are consequential, which 
then get evaluated to effectively help business achieve 
their objectives. Based on the regulatory framework of 
India, two levels of control are applied to review an arm’s 
length arrangement between related parties: a) upfront 
approval from the audit committee before the transaction is 
undertaken based on arm’s length evaluation; and b) year-
end transfer pricing compliance to report the transaction 
as to whether the same has adhered from a transfer pricing 
regulation perspective, i.e. contemptuous and robust 
documentation based on FAR analysis.
Tax reporting
Our annual report has covered tax jurisdiction, primary 
activities, number of employees, income tax paid, revenue, 
profit (loss) before tax, and income tax accrued (current year) 
in its consolidated statement on Page No. 112. The effective 
tax rate is reported on Page No. 226 (Standalone basis) and 
Page no. 301 (Consolidated basis) of the Annual Report.

as lead time, order accuracy, and cost efficiency to evaluate 
and enhance the performance of the supply chain.
Enhance the skill to rapidly respond to variations in 
demand, supply conditions, or market trends to ensure 
ongoing competitiveness and satisfy business needs.
ZEE’s code of conduct and Whistle-blower policy are 
applicable to its suppliers.
As per suppliers screening based on the business and 
engagement value, 96 suppliers have been identified as 
significant Tier 1 suppliers for FY 2023-24.
Our approach to supply chain management entails the oversight 
and coordination of all activities linked to the supply of goods and 
services. Our suppliers are categorised as content delivery partners, 
manpower supplying agency, technological suppliers, broadband 
and Internet services agencies, office consumable suppliers, etc.
We are committed to planning, 
executing, and regulating supply 
chain activities to optimise value, 
decrease costs, and ensure efficient 
operations. Effective management 
of the supply chain is vital for our 
enterprise, as it contributes to cost 
savings, enhances service quality, 
and facilitates a consistent flow of 
products and services to us.

Independent Assurance Statement to Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited on their Annual ESG Report for the Financial Year 
2023-2024 
 
Introduction and, Engagement 
 
 
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited (ZEEL), has developed its ESG Report based on the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 2021 
Standard and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) for the Media sector.  
 
TÜV SÜD South Asia Pvt. Ltd. (‘TÜV SÜD’) has been engaged by the ZEEL to conduct and provide independent assurance on the ESG 
performances and parameters on the select non-financial ESG disclosures in the ESG Report 2023-24 ('the ESG Report') as described in 
the 'scope, boundary, characteristics and limitations. 
 
Reporting period: April 01, 2023, to March 31, 2024 
 
ZEEL’s Responsibility  
 
ZEEL is responsible for preparation of the ESG Report and maintaining effective internal control over the data and information disclosed (as 
per GRI 2021 and SASB). This responsibility includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal controls relevant to the

The Reports and disclosures have been approved by and remain the responsibility of ZEEL. 
 
Ultimately, the ESG Report and disclosures have been approved by and remain the responsibility of ZEEL. 
 
TÜV SÜD Responsibility 
 
TÜV SÜD, in performing assurance work, is responsible for carrying out an assurance engagement on the ESG Report in accordance with 
our contract with ZEEL. The assurance statement, however, represents TÜV SÜD’s independent opinion and is intended to inform all 
stakeholders, including ZEEL. 
 
Assurance Level & Criteria 
• 
We applied the criteria of ‘Limited’ Assurance for information and indicators of the ESG Report with respect to the reporting period 
from April 1, 2023 to March 31, 2024. 
• 
We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised), 
Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information issued by the International Auditing 
and Assurance Standards Board. 
• 
We plan and perform our procedures to obtain a meaningful level of assurance about whether the ESG Report complies with 
GRI 2021 and SASB standards, in all material respects, as the basis for our Limited Assurance conclusion 
• 
We also referred to the "WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol (Greenhouse Gas Protocol)” as well as ISO 14064-3:2019 for GHG 
Emissions.  
 
Scope and boundary of assurance 
 
We have assured the sustainability indicators of ESG Report for the period April 1, 2023, to March 31, 2024.  
 
The validation and verification were carried out by a multidisciplinary team including assurance practitioners, sustainability and 
environmental, social & governance experts of TÜV SÜD in the month of October 2024 for 15 offices in 11 cities across the India 
including 1 corporate office in Mumbai, Maharashtra. TÜV SÜD has identified and selected the following 2 locations as samples for

Standards. Also verified the quality of information presented in the Report over the reporting period.

appropriately consolidated data from different sources at the central level. The Company has made considerable efforts to ensure the 
consistency of data for this Report; however, the Company may continue to improve robustness of its data collection and collation process

identified during the verification process were found to be attributable to transcription and interpretation errors and these errors were 
corrected immediately. Therefore, in accordance with the ISAE 3000 (Revised) assurance engagement, TÜV SÜD concludes that the ESG 
data, parameters, information, and indicators presented in the Reports are reliable and acceptable.
